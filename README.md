## Can You Hack?
This python script helps you answer the nagging question of if something can be hacked by querying your
Tenable Security Center. 

#Prerequisites

pySecurityCenter library

You need to provide this information in the script:
username = ''
password = ''
host = '' 

(I would suggest creating a stand alone 'executive role' user for this) 

# Usage
python canyouhack.py 127.0.0.1

#Important Notice
*I donâ€™t know what I am doing. This will likely break your system. *
